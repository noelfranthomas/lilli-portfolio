Hello! My name is Lilli Bea. I have always loved painting and creating art. Painting is one of the ways I choose to express myself and show others what I am thinking. Sometimes I use my art to admire the world around me, by painting nature. Other times I just want to create something fun that different people may find interesting. I especially love bringing other people's visions to life, which is why I hope to connect with others and create commissioned paintings. I take pride in all of the art pieces that I create, so if you choose to invest in a Lilli Bea original your painting will be made with care. Please feel free to contact me for more information if you are interested in commissioned work. I look forward to working with you!

I believe it is important to give back to my community, so I pledge to donate 20% of all sales to the Calgary Women's Emergency Shelter.
